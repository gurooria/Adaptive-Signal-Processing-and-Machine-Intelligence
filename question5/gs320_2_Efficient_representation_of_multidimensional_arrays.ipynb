The elements of the core tensor interact with the factor matrices in such a way that the original tensor can be approximated or reconstructed through a series of mode-n products. The order of the core tensor is the same as the order of the original tensor. This means if X is an Nth-order tensor, then G is also an Nth-order tensor. Thus, we need to consider the possible orders of the core tensor if it contains 1848 elements. The prime number factorisation of 1848 leads to 6 consitutent values: i.e. 1848 =  2x2x2x3x7x11. Therefore given that the maximum order of the core tensor is 6, the tensor order is also limited to a maximum of 6 and can take any value from 1 to 6.\"  # use this variable for your answer\n",

In mathematical terms, the Kruskal model is depicted using a core tensor that has non-zero elements only on its superdiagonal, reflecting the weighting of each rank-one tensor.
